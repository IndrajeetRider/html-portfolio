<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Indrajeet "Rider" was no ordinary cyclist. He was known throughout the city as a fierce, almost mythic figure—legend says he was a Ghost Rider of a different kind, but instead of a roaring motorcycle, he rode a humble yet powerful cycle, Rocky 2.0. It wasn’t just any cycle though; Rocky 2.0 was a custom-built beast, forged in the fires of a small but mystical workshop in Rajajinagar. With its flaming wheels and a chain made of celestial steel, Rocky 2.0 could reach speeds no mortal cycle ever dreamed of.

  Indrajeet, or "Rider" as he became known, was cursed—or blessed, depending on who you asked. One fateful night, after winning a brutal underground cycling competition, he stumbled upon a relic—a handlebar wrapped in ancient leather. It once belonged to the original Ghost Rider, but rather than motorcycles, this rider rode bicycles. Upon gripping the handlebars, his fate was sealed. The spirit of vengeance was now bound to him.</p>

<p>Whenever the night fell, and injustice reared its ugly head, Indrajeet would transform. His once normal appearance became ghostly, with his eyes glowing like embers and a spectral flame engulfing his cycle. Rocky 2.0, with its bell ringing a haunting chime, would roar to life, leaving trails of fire in its wake as they patrolled the streets. His powers? Indrajeet could summon the "Penance Puncture," where he would pierce the tires of evil-doers' vehicles, forcing them to ride the shameful path of walking!

  Comic-accurate to a T, Indrajeet's arch-nemesis was the villainous "Oil Baron," who profited off people’s dependency on motorized vehicles. The Baron, with his corrupted fleet of gas-guzzling monsters, sought to eliminate bicycles from the world. But Indrajeet, on Rocky 2.0, was a force the Baron could never quite outrun.</p>

<p>Indrajeet ‘Rider’ was not just a hero for the streets—he was a reminder that sometimes, the most powerful rides are the ones powered by your own two feet… or a cursed celestial cycle that shoots flames.</p>
